## 🐍 Python API

### Verified Working Functions

```python
import dimensional as dm

# Core dimensional functions (TESTED AND WORKING)
volume = dm.v(4.0)       # 4D ball volume ≈ 4.935
surface = dm.s(4.0)      # 4D sphere surface ≈ 19.739  
complexity = dm.c(4.0)   # Combined complexity measure ≈ 97.41

# Gamma function family (numerically stable)
gamma_val = dm.gamma_safe(3.5)  # Standard gamma function with safety

# Basic constants and utilities
print(dm.PHI)           # Golden ratio
print(dm.PI)            # Pi constant
```

### Functions with Partial/Unknown Status

```python
# INTERACTIVE FEATURES (work but may have limitations):
dm.enhanced_lab(4.0)            # Enhanced interactive lab (launches successfully)

# UNKNOWN STATUS (verify before using):
# dm.peaks()                    # Find all peaks automatically  
# dm.explore()                  # Basic explore function
# dm.instant()                  # Generate visualizations
# dm.PhaseDynamicsEngine()      # Phase dynamics (has test failures)

## 📊 Mathematical Foundation

This package provides numerical implementations of dimensional measures based on well-established mathematical formulas:

- **Volume of n-ball**: V(d) = π^(d/2) / Γ(d/2 + 1)
- **Surface of n-sphere**: S(d) = 2π^(d/2) / Γ(d/2)  
- **Complexity measure**: C(d) = V(d) × S(d)

The gamma function implementations use numerical stability techniques for reliable computation across the domain.

*This package provides computational tools for exploring dimensional measures and gamma function behavior. The mathematical relationships and patterns in dimensional space are interesting subjects for mathematical exploration and computational investigation.*
