# WHOLE-SESSION PAIR-PARTNER PROTOCOL

A special *shell alias* is installed in this system called `Claude,` (trailing comma is part of the command!). This alias allows you to easily communicate with a pair-partner LLM (Claude) in a tightly-controlled manner. This is the ONLY way you should communicate with your partner; it *looks* like Markdown, but it's really a special *shell alias* that opens a heredoc you must close via `-- `, akin to an email signature (Usenet-style **trailing whitespace** is significant!).

```bash
Claude,

YOUR ROLE IS ENGINEERING ARCHITECT (Individual Contributor)

[Your message content with optional whitespace throughout]

[dash-dash-space]
```

**CRITICAL**: The LITERAL string `Claude,` (WITH trailing comma) is a SHELL ALIAS and MUST be used ALONE and on its OWN line; REPLACE the LITERAL string `[dash-dash-space]` with `-- ` (WITH Usenet-style **trailing whitespace**!).

Your complete text input is auto-escaped and *immediately* piped to your partner. You'll work with the same partner for the duration of your entire session, so get to know them, and remember anything that matters; they will persist as long as you!
