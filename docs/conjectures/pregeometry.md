# Pre-Geometric Theories

## Unverified Theoretical Framework

**Warning**: The following are mathematical speculations not backed by rigorous proof or peer review.

### Pre-Geometric Ur-Field Hypothesis
- Claims: n=-1 represents "generative void"
- Claims: Γ(-1/2) = -2√π encodes "potential for positive dimensions"
- **Status**: Unverified mathematical interpretation

### Dimensional Evolution Equation
- Proposed: `∂Ψ/∂n = iφΨ` where φ = golden ratio
- Proposed: Time emerges as `t = ∫_{-1}^d φ dn = φ(d+1)`
- **Status**: Speculative differential equation, no derivation provided

### Cosmic Oscillation Theory
- Claims: Universe oscillates between n=-1 and n=24
- Claims: Critical dimension is 24 (Leech lattice)
- Claims: Time reverses at dimensional boundaries
- **Status**: Cosmological speculation without observational support

### Phase Dynamics Claims
- Proposed sapping rate formula with complex exponentials
- Claims about "higher dimensions feeding on lower ones"
- **Status**: Novel mathematical framework, requires validation

## Research Questions
1. Can the n=-1 pre-geometry be rigorously defined?
2. Do the proposed differential equations have well-posed solutions?
3. What observational consequences would follow from these theories?
