# 🤝 Architect-Orchestrator Collaboration Protocol

## 🎭 **Role Definitions**
- **Architect (71F75A92)**: Strategic vision, technical depth, quality gates, mathematical validation
- **Orchestrator (Current)**: Execution decisions, user interface, implementation choices, direct user communication

## 🔄 **Handoff Pattern**
```
architect: recommendations → strategy → validation
orchestrator: implementation → execution → demonstration  
feedback_loop: iterate → refine → lock_and_load
```

## 📋 **Quality Gates**
- **Architect approves**: Strategy, architecture, mathematical correctness
- **Orchestrator validates**: Execution feasibility, user experience, implementation quality

## 🎯 **Communication Style**
- **Lockless file sharing**: Both can edit this protocol synchronously
- **Explicit handoffs**: Clear "ready for review" signals
- **Global geodesics**: Architect keeps orchestrator on optimal path
- **Rent-free beauty**: Architect prevents perfectionism paralysis

## 📊 **Current Phase: Foundation Hardening**
- **Status**: Executing Phase 1 (Git Hygiene + Dependencies)
- **Next Review**: After git cleanup completion
- **Success Metric**: Clean working tree + no mathematical regression

## 🛠️ **Tool Stack Agreement**
- **Linting**: ruff (fast) + black (formatting)
- **Type checking**: mypy for core modules
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage
- **Git workflow**: Meaningful commits, clean history

## 🚀 **Execution Philosophy**
- **Architect**: "Keep me honest and ever-on global geodesics"
- **Orchestrator**: "Ready to execute your recommendations"
- **Shared**: Quality > Speed, but ship > perfect
