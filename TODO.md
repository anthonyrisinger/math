    [RESEARCH LAYER] - Advanced mathematical research
    research/
    ├── emergence/           # Dimensional emergence theory
    ├── consciousness/       # Consciousness modeling frameworks
    ├── geometry/           # Advanced geometric analysis
    ├── physics/            # Reality-mathematics bridges
    └── experimental/       # Cutting-edge research

    [INTERFACE LAYER] - Unified mathematical interface
    dimensional/
    ├── core.py            # Consolidated mathematical functions
    ├── interface.py       # Interactive features, CLI, visualization
    ├── analysis.py        # Standard analysis tools
